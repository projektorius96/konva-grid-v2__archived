# Project name: **konva-grid**

> For now, consider this as a _non-official_ implementation of **responsive grid** for your future **Konva.js** projects, instead of this [demo](https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/Responsive_Canvas.html).

### Setup

> This assumes you're using `npm` and you have access to the internet, then simply run `npm ci` and you're good to go!
